what do you care? you're an actor. this is your day job. this isn't supposed to mean anything to you.,chandler

really? me?,rachel
"yes. oh my god, are you kidding? ross is so crazy about you, and i really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.",julie

oy.,julie
"um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, i just, i see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, monica's always saying how nice you are, and god i hate it when she's right.",rachel

huh.,ross
"i mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily?",rachel

"the ones that got me the porsche! will you keep up! but i figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that i don’t own it. so i figured i’ll wash it. right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow?",joey

he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!,chandler
"no chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! and also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.",phoebe
"they’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!",chandler
what?!,phoebe
"glass, sand, whatever.",chandler

oh it’s so cute. i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.,monica
"oh, i can still do that.",phoebe
how are you still single?!,monica
i thought about it and maybe you’re right. maybe krog is not a safe toy.,chandler
good. what made you change your mind?,monica
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun.,chandler
how did that happen?!!,phoebe
"well, i was trying to prove that i was right. y’know? and it turns out i was wrong. and now it’s lodged in my throat.",chandler

"a judge’s chambers, rachel and ross are filing their annulment papers.]",break
okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?,judge
"yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.",rachel
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr. geller is mentally unstable.,judge
"fine, i’m mentally unstable.",ross
and based on the fact that mr. geller is intravenous drug user.,judge
what?!,ross
"uh yes, heroin and crack.",rachel
crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!,ross
"well, you would know.",rachel
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?,judge
"oh, come on!",ross
"ross, please, i found the magazines!",rachel
"and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.",judge
"okay, i’m sorry, this is insane! i-i-i’m not addicted to heroin, i’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! look, i’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!",ross
that won’t be necessary.,judge
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!,ross
ugh!,rachel
"now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.",judge
"ross! your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! and could you strike ""consummated like bunnies"" from the record?",rachel
"is there, anything in this record that is actually true?",judge
"well, yes, we got married in vegas and uh, and the names i think.",rachel
"well, based on what i heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. if you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.",judge
"that’s great! are you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form!",ross
what?! me?! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!,rachel
and what— stop typing! stop typing!!,ross
"okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!",rachel
you need to get out of my chambers.,judge
"all right look lady here is the deal, i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one!",rachel
yeah!,ross
would you like to spend the night in jail?,judge
and thank you for your time.,rachel

so the porsche guy took his car back.,joey
but you found the keys to his clothes?,chandler
"no. no, i just uh, i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.",joey
and people will think you own a porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?,monica
of course! only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! right?,joey
that is true.,chandler
"yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.",phoebe
"oh, i’ve been there. yeah, i am gonna go drive my porsche.",joey
"joey, you know you don’t actually have one.",monica
come on! what are you doing?! i’m in character! would you talk to her!,joey
"ahh, i think it just moved. it’s really poking me.",chandler
"all right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.",monica
"what?! no, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! we’re baby-sitting!",phoebe
"the babies are asleep, i’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!",monica
but you-you can’t leave me with them! we-we’re a team! we’re playing a zone! they’re gonna triple team me!,phoebe
"he’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.",monica
"but no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.",phoebe
i think that’s gum.,chandler
i’m pretty sure it’s gun.,phoebe

a real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!,phoebe

hey!,chandler
how do you feel?,phoebe
"well, let’s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.",chandler
"okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself! i fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.",phoebe

oh my god.,monica
"i know, the babies are asleep.",phoebe
"phoebe, what, what happened here?!",monica
i did it! i took care of the babies all by myself!,phoebe
but my apartment!,monica
was the setting of phoebe’s triumph.,chandler
but the mess!,monica
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.,chandler
"you’re right, you’re right i shouldn’t freak out. ‘cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies! when will that be?!",monica
"phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",chandler
"ross’s apartment, rachel is packing what she still has over there as ross enters.]",break
"oh honey thank god you’re home, i was getting worried.",rachel
"i picked up the divorce papers. uh, i’ve already signed everything and i put little ‘x’s where you need to sign.",ross
"oh, little ‘x’s! great! that makes up for everything!",rachel
"y’know, i-i—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! okay?",ross
"oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!",rachel
"okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding! ah, how about you told me you loved me after i was already married!",ross
hey! wait a minute! that was different! i did those things because i was in love with you!,rachel
yeah! right!,ross
"you’re right. that’s very different. so let’s, let’s just sign the papers. all right? what?",ross
nothing.,rachel
"okay, can we just sign please?",ross
uh-hmm.,rachel
congratulations.,ross
"okay ross, we’re—wait a minute. umm, i uh, i kinda have a little confession.",rachel
what?,ross
"well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",rachel
excuse me?,ross
"well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",rachel
yeah?,ross
"and uh, yeah, i didn’t really, i didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. and uh, and i thought it would be funnier if we got married. so as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. so umm, sorry i got us into this mess.",rachel
"so then if-if—i mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.",ross
"yeah, don’t push it though.",rachel
"i’ve got to say; i know i divorce a lot of women, never thought i would be divorcing you.",ross
"i know. i always thought if you and i got married, it would be the one that stuck. and it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut.",rachel
"did i, did i even treat?",ross
"no, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",rachel
that may be the most depressing thing i’ve heard in my life. i should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.,ross

w-what was the one right before bananas?,ross
"the beef? yeah, that was weird to me, too. but then, y’know, i thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” i mean that’s an english dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. oh! by the way, can i borrow some rum from your place?",rachel

what?! why did you do that?,chandler
"i don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, i’m i’m sorry. i-i didn’t think it would matter.",ross
how could it not matter?!,chandler

"i don’t know, i-i was all high.",ross
"rachel’s old bedroom, continued from earlier. monica enters the room.]",break

your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!,chandler
"ross, i can’t believe you’d do that!",monica
"the reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? so will you fix this?",chandler

you! it’s not like it’s a big deal! you-you don’t still do it or anything!,monica
"alright, alright, now-now who should i say tricked me into doing it?",ross
"monica and chandler’s, time lapse. jack is still on the couch, picking his teeth with his feet on the table. phoebe and judy are sitting on the table looking at him. ross and chandler are sitting by the window talking. rachel and joey are in the kitchen fooling with rachel’s trifle. monica walks into the living room from the kitchen.]",break
"dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-",monica

well you’re whippin’ so slow! can’t you do it any faster?,joey
"joey! come on! i don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like “oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?”",rachel
"so why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?",rachel
oh i am!,joey
"ross, if you don’t tell them, then i will!",monica
"okay, fine!",ross

"what?! what is with everybody? it’s thanksgiving, not...truth-day!",ross
"look, when everyone eats that...that...banana-meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?",joey

mmm.,all
"yeah, this is so good, that i’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.",chandler
"i’ve gotta call my friend mary and tell her how good this is, from monica’s room.",mrs. geller

"...so a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?",rachel
"yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.",chandler
"rachel, come here. okay, i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap, and i had another dream about jack.",phoebe
"oh, phoebe, do i wanna hear this?",rachel
"i dunno, let’s see! so, okay, i dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. and, um, so okay, i went to a night club, and i saw him making out with a girl.",phoebe
"oh my god, he dream-cheated on you!",rachel
"yeah, but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! it was soo cool! then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.",phoebe
"boy, i’m glad i wore the big belt today.",mr. geller
"five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. now nothing. well, not nothing, i am still a woman.",phoebe

"yeah, well, hurricane gloria didn’t break the porch swing, monica did!",ross

"monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.",mrs. geller
and we kinda figured about the porch swing.,mr. geller
"ross, drugs? divorced? again?",mrs. geller
what happened son?,mr. geller
"i-i uh, i got tricked into all those things!",ross

"that’s a good story, grandpa.",rachel
hey,ross
hey,all
"wow, monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! did someone get her drunk again or?",ross
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about. it’s about being with the people that you love.,monica
that is nice and we’re done. tada!,phoebe
"i dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like christmas to me.",chandler
"oh, here.",monica
see now it feels like christmas!,chandler
"central perk, everyone except phoebe and joey are there.]",break
"… and that’s the story of the dreidle. now, some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. and that was like 4000 years ago.",ross
"so, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",rachel
hey you guys.,joey
hey joe what’s up?,chandler
"i had to get out of the apartment. janine is like stretching all over the place. y’know, everywhere i look she’s like…",joey

"oh. maybe. but hey i know how i can find out. we’re going to a new year’s eve party, right? so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great! y’know? but if she says ‘dude, what the hell are you doing?’ i can say ‘it wasn’t me, it was new years!’",joey
"well, that’s a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.",rachel
it was a dry day.,ross
we are going to dick clark’s new year’s rocking eve!,monica
oh my god!,ross

"she puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. does anyone know why that is? it’s a tradition left over from porsche’s racing history. the world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans. which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday. in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. at the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. the driver’s left hand did nothing. porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. that’s why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}",{transcriber’s note

"oh really. okay. let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffee house, i went to the bathroom and when i came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",phoebe
"somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and i said ""hey don't eat that-that's phoebe's"" and he said.. <pause> he said.. ""joey you stink at lying."" what am i going to do?",joey

"my boyfriend canceled on me. i mean.. i i finally find a real relationship. i mean, someone that i can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. i swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.",amy

oh. i was so looking forward to this. it was going to be such a beautiful thanksgiving. we were going to have sushi.,amy
"oh amy, don't cry amy. um.. ross, could i talk to you in private?",rachel
"sure, you want to go upstairs?",ross
um look i was thinking.. if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving.,rachel
"you know, i think thats a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.",ross
"look i know she's a little tough to take. she has no where else to go, and she's my sister. alright, she's emma's aunt. and i would like them to bond.",rachel
"ok, fine, but i don't want them bonding to much. i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.",ross

phoe-be.,phoebe shakes her hand and says
oh. that's a funny noise.,amy
"pheebs, i still need some help here",joey
"oh right, ok um. ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . for example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",phoebe
oh.. i don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor.,joey
you are a terrific actor.,phoebe looks down
hey. hey where's the baby?,amy coming out of the bathroom
oh we just put her down for a nap.,rachel
oh i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible? if you guys died.,amy
thank you amy.,ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy
"no, no, then i would get the baby. i mean you know it would be just like a movie. like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her, then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i'd get married.",amy
thats a great movie. <she claps>,phoebe
"now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. i was thinking about changing her name. i'm just not really a big fan of emily.",amy
emma.,ross
"emma, ross wants you.",amy turns around to phoebe
phoe-be.,phoebe
why does she keep making that noise?,amy turns to ross and rachel
"honey, i don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.",rachel
well who would?,amy
"well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want monica and chandler.",ross
i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.,chandler
"yeah oh my god, i'm so moved.",monica
"i don't believe this, hold on a second. you guys die and i don't get your baby?",amy
"see look amy, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler. we see them every day. and truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",rachel
connected? i mean.. to what? she's.. she's a lump.,amy
"you know, guys i got to say. this means so much to me. that you would trust me with your child. i mean, we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own. you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>",chandler
<points to chandler> this guy? seriously?,amy
okay! it's time for dinner. everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,monica
woah. woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> woah.,ross starts playing with a plate
"okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches ross' arm>",monica
hey! how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,joey
"no, honey, its. thats a special plate. see its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",monica
i can't believe i won.,joey
its such a slap in the face. i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.,amy
monica is ross' sister.,rachel
"no, ross' sister was really fat.",amy
that was me.,monica
"no, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog.",amy
hey. amy. you've got to stop doing that.,rachel
"okay, listen i know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. i mean, i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this.",monica about to have a heart attack
"now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",monica
"okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do i get the baby?",amy
"no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right?",chandler
well actually...,rachel
actually what?,chandler
"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. emma would go to my parents.",ross
what?,chandler
"hurts, doesn't it?",amy
uh.. who has to die for me to get her?,joey raises his hand
"so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough to raise emma?",chandler
"no, that that is not what we're saying.",ross looks down
yeah he's lying. he looked down.,joey
well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent? because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,chandler
"honey, you're taking this the wrong way. we think you're going to be a wonderful parent. it's just.. you're more the fun parent.",rachel
yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,ross
"thats not how you see me, is it?",monica
no you're all about the fun.,phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air
"look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable?",chandler
"no, you both are equally capable. its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",ross
ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table> she'd have to give her up.,chandler
"sure, monica would have to give her up.",ross
"i lie better then that, right?",joey
"so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",chandler
there's your movie! <claps>,phoebe
hey. there you are. you disappeared after dinner.,monica
oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise poorly?,chandler
ross and rachel don't know what they're talking about. i mean its not like their so responsible. emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom.,monica
"yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong father figure and i never will be.",chandler
no you learn these things. you grow into it.,monica
"yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody knows it.",chandler
i don't know it! i want to have a kid with you because i think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,monica
"oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""go to your room! you're grounded""?",chandler
"can you hear me say ""you're grounded""?",monica
you said that to me last week.,chandler
how hard is it? no shoes on the furniture.,monica
the producer from days left a message on my machine asking why i wasn't at the parade. they said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> and they all got to meet santa!,joey groans and gets off the phone
it's ok. i thought of the perfect lie for you. it's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. you weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,phoebe
"oh, i like that, yeah. wasn't at the parade because i had a family emergency.",joey
"ooh, what happened?",phoebe
oh.. my sister's raccoon.,joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear
no! nothing with a raccoon.,phoebe
"arg... alright, i'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>",joey
oh wait.. what are you doing?,monica
setting the table.,joey
yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,phoebe
oh how nice. maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.,monica
"hey dude, you okay? sorry about before.",ross
"oh no thats okay, you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child. but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die, you don't get joey.",chandler
"ucch. <pauses> uchh <louder this time> in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you.",amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to rachel
uchh! <much louder and longer then amy's>,rachel
you know.. this.. this is classic rachel.,amy
yeah.. yeah right.. remember in high school when i died and didn't give you my baby?,rachel
"this might be my one chance to have a baby rachel. i mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my carrer.",amy
what? what carrer?,rachel
um.. i'm a decorator.,amy
ok. you decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. okay! i went to the zoo yesterday and now i'm a koala bear.,rachel
why can't you ever be supportive?,amy
sup.. you want to talk supportive? you didn't even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby.,rachel
oh. yeah. well.. you didn't come see me when i was in the hospital when i was getting my lips done.,amy
i did the first time! oh. oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> and you know what. you want to know why i'm not giving emily to you.,rachel
emma.,ross
oh whose side are you on? <back to amy> i'm not giving you emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.,rachel turns to ross
how hard could it be? you do it.,amy
ooh oooh..,joey
do you want to know why you don't want me to have the baby?,amy
uh huh.,rachel
because you don't want me to be happy. you.. you have always been jealous of me.,amy
"jealous of what? of your lack of responsiblity? you, your immaturity? your total disregard of other people's feelings?",rachel
"uh.. to name a few. you know.. you know.. you've just always been like this. you just have to have everything. and i couldn't have anything. like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me. i mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?",amy
timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,rachel
"oh come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it.",amy
"i cannot, i cannot believe that i invited you here today.",rachel
"yeah, well you know what i cannot believe. that my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from ralph lauren and i still have to pay retail.",amy
ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> it's forty five.,rachel
"you bitch. you just think you're so perfect. with your new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> well let me tell you something. your baby isn't even that cute.",amy

ew! gross.,rachel
"alright! that is it. this is our apartment and you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize to her right now.",chandler
i'm sorry.,amy
"mon, i'm so sorry.",rachel
okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,chandler

"oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first.",chandler
